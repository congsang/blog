As I mentioned in the title of the article, why do we need use pilot project to prove feasibility? Is it really necessary?

Before answering those questions, we go through some concepts

#### What does "pilot project" mean?
Generally, a pilot project is usually some kind of part project or simulated project designed to test an idea. 
The output come of a pilot project is a successful/ unsuccessful conclusion.
It is all about learning the incompatibility to provide solution for a given problem. 
It verifies the major functionality of the system before going into production.
<!-- This testing is done exactly between the UAT and Production.
Pilot Testing helps in early detection of bugs in the System.
Pilot testing will answer the question like, whether the product or service have a potential market. -->

#### Why Pilot?
The objective of a pilot project is to provide information that will enable management to make a better decision about a potential project or programme. 
In the beginning may be in bits and pieces, being less risky rather than gaining much larger benefits that are projected later.
Now, we understand the part of the pilot project. What are the real benefits it brings to the project? I know you still don't know the benefits of a pilot project
So, there are numerous reasons to pilot::
- It will help to check if your product is ready for full-scale implementation
- It will help to make better decision on allotment of time and resources
- It will give an opportunity to gauge your target population's reaction to the program
- It will help to measure the success of your program
- It will give the team a chance to uncover and practice the activities they will be using during the usability test.

#### Summary
<!-- - To be sure, we need to validate our approach, confirm that why I am choosing a tool, language, cost and most importantly the ROI. -->
<!-- - This testing is done exactly between the UAT and Production.  -->
- With your choice, pilot project will change your development and testing processes. The sooner you have some, the sooner you can start making changes. 
- It will help easier to secure the resources and cooperation youâ€™ll need to be successful with the larger effort.

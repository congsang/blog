		<p>As you well know, many programmers are always subjected to a lot of daily work pressure like the deadline, fix bug, overtime, etc.</p>
<p>Under that presure, can you guarantee that the application is not broken?</p>
<p>Not sure yet, the fix might or might not address the full generality of the bug. You must retest the test case to make sure that the previous defect has been repaired</p>
<h4 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h4><p>To have quality product, keep in mind, the application is always buggy. So, you must retest to makes sure that the original fault has been corrected.   </p>

		<p>In my early days in the software testing, I heard people talk about the severity and priority, but I don’t seem to understand it yet. Have you encountered similar situation?</p>
<p>If yes, with me going around this post :)</p>
<h4 id="What-is-Severity"><a href="#What-is-Severity" class="headerlink" title="What is Severity?"></a>What is Severity?</h4><p>Whenever we refer to Severity of a defect, we are indicating the impact of the defect on the application’s functionality. There are several levels to severity of a defect:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Critical:</strong> A defect causes the application to crash or corrupts data and blocks the user from performing any actions.</li>
<li><strong>Major:</strong> A defect that causes one or more components of an application to fail but does not block the user from using other areas of the application.</li>
<li><strong>Minor:</strong> A defect that affects the usability of the application but usually has a workaround.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="What-is-Priority"><a href="#What-is-Priority" class="headerlink" title="What is Priority?"></a>What is Priority?</h4><p>Whenever we refer to Priority of a defect, we are indicating the time frame within which the defect needs to be fixed/resolved. Like Severity, there are different levels to Priority as well:</p>
<!-- A simple way, when you encounter a fatal error to your application, what is the first thing you think of? 

Right away, report bug to the programmer includes a notice that must be fixed immediately. That's why we need priority in bug reporting -->
<ol>
<li><strong>High:</strong> The defect needs to be resolved within a working day. Because the defect is affecting the application or the product severely. The system cannot be used until the  repair has been done.</li>
<li><strong>Medium:</strong> The defect should be resolved in the normal course of development activities. It can later be tested in another build or version. These defects do not crash the application.</li>
<li><strong>Low:</strong> This defect does not affect functionality and has workarounds. It should therefore be fixed only after other important issues are resolved.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="A-few-examples-in-fact"><a href="#A-few-examples-in-fact" class="headerlink" title="A few examples in fact"></a>A few examples in fact</h4><p>To easily visualize, let’s take a look at the picture below. And I will take a few examples of the relationship between them.<br><img src="/congsang.github.com/images/lesson-learned/matrix.PNG" alt="matrix"></p>
<p><strong>High Priority &amp; High Severity:</strong> An e-commercial site, purchase function does not work, high impact on business results, so high priority should be given.<br><strong>Low Severity &amp; High Priority:</strong> The logo or name of the company is not displayed on the website. It is important to fix the issue as soon as possible, although it may not cause a lot of damage.<br><strong>High Severity &amp; Low Priority:</strong> Error game, the game you have 60 level, at level 40 it crashed/failed to play. This is a serious error, but to achieve this level requires players to play a few months, so we can set the lower priority.<br><strong>Low Priority and Low Severity:</strong> The privacy policy page take a long time to load. Not many people view the privacy policy page and slow loading doesn’t affect the customers much, so set to low priority.</p>
<h4 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h4><p>Come to conclusion, we have things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Severity refers to the impact or consequence of the bug. </li>
<li>Priority indicates when your company wants it fixed. </li>
</ul>

		</h3>
	


		     <div class="entry">
  <div class="row">
	
	
		<p>As I mentioned in the title of the article, why do we need use pilot project to prove feasibility? Is it really necessary?</p>
<p>Before answering those questions, we go through some concepts</p>
<h4 id="What-does-“pilot-project”-mean"><a href="#What-does-“pilot-project”-mean" class="headerlink" title="What does “pilot project” mean?"></a>What does “pilot project” mean?</h4><p>Generally, a pilot project is usually some kind of part project or simulated project designed to test an idea.<br>The output come of a pilot project is a successful/ unsuccessful conclusion.<br>It is all about learning the incompatibility to provide solution for a given problem.<br>It verifies the major functionality of the system before going into production.<br><!-- This testing is done exactly between the UAT and Production.
Pilot Testing helps in early detection of bugs in the System.
Pilot testing will answer the question like, whether the product or service have a potential market. --></p>
<h4 id="Why-Pilot"><a href="#Why-Pilot" class="headerlink" title="Why Pilot?"></a>Why Pilot?</h4><p>The objective of a pilot project is to provide information that will enable management to make a better decision about a potential project or programme.<br>In the beginning may be in bits and pieces, being less risky rather than gaining much larger benefits that are projected later.<br>Now, we understand the part of the pilot project. What are the real benefits it brings to the project? I know you still don’t know the benefits of a pilot project<br>So, there are numerous reasons to pilot::</p>
<ul>
<li>It will help to check if your product is ready for full-scale implementation</li>
<li>It will help to make better decision on allotment of time and resources</li>
<li>It will give an opportunity to gauge your target population’s reaction to the program</li>
<li>It will help to measure the success of your program</li>
<li>It will give the team a chance to uncover and practice the activities they will be using during the usability test.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h4><!-- - To be sure, we need to validate our approach, confirm that why I am choosing a tool, language, cost and most importantly the ROI. -->
<!-- - This testing is done exactly between the UAT and Production.  -->
<ul>
<li>With your choice, pilot project will change your development and testing processes. The sooner you have some, the sooner you can start making changes. </li>
<li>It will help easier to secure the resources and cooperation you’ll need to be successful with the larger effort.</li>
</ul>
